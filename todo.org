** DONE As a user I can pick up items
*** DONE Map must hold items
If I am unable to hold the item due to having too much weight it will not be picked up
** TODO As a user I can list the items in my inventory
** TODO As a user I can drop items on the ground
** TODO As a user I can attack with an equipped weapon
There will be several base weapon types that will have different mecnahics
This story invloves creating the general/melee weapon base type
** TODO As a user I can equip items in my inventory as weapons
Items that do not have the weapon property will map to a generic weapon
** TODO As a user I can unequip a weapon and it will return to my inventory
** TODO As a user I can consume items in my inventory
Items with either the food or drink flag will replenish the relevant nutrition scores
** TODO As a designer I can create items and instance them in game
Ideally from something like a spreadsheet
** TODO As a designer I can create npc characters and instance them in game
Ideally from something like a spreadsheet but xml might be okay here
